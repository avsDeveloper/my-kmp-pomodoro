# KMP Experiment

This project is an experiment to create Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) without the use of an IDE.

## Features
- Cross-platform development for Android, iOS, and Desktop.
- Shared business logic across platforms.
- Dependency Injection with Koin.
- Coroutines for asynchronous programming.

## Architecture
- The project follows a modular architecture to separate concerns and promote code reuse.
- Each platform has its own UI implementation, while the business logic is shared.

## Build Instructions
1. Ensure you have the latest version of Kotlin installed.
2. Use Gradle to build the project.
3. Follow specific instructions for each platform in their respective directories.
